# Python_JumpGame
Made with pygame following a tutorial. 

Takes user keyboard inputs to move a cube left or right and jump. Platforms are randomly generated as the player ascends. Created game loops, classes for player and surfaces. 
When booted the player object rests on a surface object that tells the player to stop moving.

The player can jump, and the player's jump height will be decided by the time the spacebar is held.

The movement mechanics were taken from a guide, establishing velocity and friction constants to help make the movement coding easier.
